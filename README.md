# Task-5-Train-Test-Split-Evaluation-Metrics
# Heart Disease Prediction

This project uses the Heart Disease dataset to train a Logistic Regression model. Data is split into training and testing sets. The model predicts heart disease and is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix. This task demonstrates basic machine learning model training, testing, and evaluation skills using Python and scikit-learn.
